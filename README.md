# Personal-Projects-Simple
A collection of code projects that I have built simply for my own amusement. Any large projects will likely receive their own repository - this is meant more for small files of code and as a place for this readme to exist so I can provide details about school projects (see below).

# School projects completed
For academic integrity reasons I have decided against making my school projects public as I do not want to facilitate cheating off of my code due to easy online availability. As an alternative, I will simply detail some of the projects I have completed.

## Tank Wars

## Asteroids
